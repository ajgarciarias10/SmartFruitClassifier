# SmartFruit Clasiffier

## Now 
Kyrilo and Antonio are developing a code that detects with machine learning applied, fruit as for example:
    
- Apples
- Bananas
- Avocado
- Pomegranate
- Red-GrapeFruit

## Requirements
#### Python Version: 3.10
### Datasets : From Kaggle and OpenImagesV7
#### Name of dataset: OpenImages v7
[URL of dataset](https://g.co/dataset/open-)

License of dataset: licensed by Google Inc. under CC BY 4.0 license. 

The images are listed as having a CC BY 2.0 license.

Short description of dataset and use case(s): bigger than ImageNet with 61M image level labels, 16M bounding boxes, 3M visual relationships, 2.7M instance segmentation masks, 600k localized narratives (synchronized audio and text caption, with mouse trace), and 66M point labels.

##### Program that work with  OpenImagesV7 FiftyOne
##### Instalation Guide
 [URL](https://docs.voxel51.com/tutorials/open_images.html)
##### Code that runs that for download images and exportIt
- [Code](loadFiftyOne.py)


#### Todo
Only working downloading photos of apples
Decide the model of learning that we are goin to do
